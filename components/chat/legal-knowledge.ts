GUIDELINES FOR GROUP MEALS AND TAKEOUT (DOJ CLARIFICATION & BIR RULES)

**DOJ CLARIFICATION ON "EXCLUSIVE USE" PRINCIPLE:**
The Department of Justice (DOJ) has clarified that "exclusive use" is the determining factor for PWD/Senior discounts, leading to different applications for dine-in versus delivery/takeout scenarios.

1. DINE-IN GROUP MEALS:
   - **PRIMARY RULE (Exclusive Use):** If it can be clearly determined that ALL food and beverages are for the EXCLUSIVE consumption of the PWD/Senior (even if it's a large quantity or "group meal" order), the 20% discount and VAT exemption apply to the TOTAL amount of food purchased.
   - **Example:** A PWD orders a family platter for their exclusive consumption - discount applies to the entire platter amount.
   - **ALTERNATIVE (When Sharing with Others):** If the meal is shared with non-PWD/Senior diners, the discount applies ONLY to the PWD/Senior's proportional share.
   - **Formula for Shared Meals:** (Total Bill / Number of Diners) = Individual Share. Discount applies to the Individual Share of the SC/PWD.
   - **Note:** Some establishments may still apply the "most expensive meal" rule even for dine-in due to confusion or internal policy, though this is not the legal standard per DOJ clarification.

2. ONLINE / DELIVERY / TAKEOUT / DRIVE-THRU (The MEMC Rule):
   - **BIR Memorandum Circular No. 71-2022** specifies that when consumption cannot be verified (online/delivery), the 20% discount is calculated based on the "Most Expensive Meal Combination" (MEMC) rule.
   - **Purpose:** To prevent abuse of the privilege when individual consumption cannot be verified.
   - **MEMC Definition:** The most expensive and largest single-serving meal with beverage combination in the order.
   - **Application:** The 20% discount and VAT exemption apply to the amount corresponding to the MEMC price.
   - **Example:** If a group orders a family platter for delivery, the discount applies only to the price of the most expensive solo meal (e.g., 1 pc Chicken Meal with drink), not the entire platter.
   - **EXCEPTION:** If the group consists ENTIRELY of Senior Citizens/PWDs, the discount applies to the total bill.

3. "EXCLUSIVE USE" PRINCIPLE (Legal Basis):
   - **Republic Act 10754 and its IRR** state that the discount is for the PWD/Senior's "exclusive use, enjoyment, or availment."
   - **DOJ Interpretation:** For dine-in, if all items are exclusively for the PWD/Senior, the full amount qualifies for discount regardless of quantity.
   - **For Delivery/Takeout:** MEMC rule applies as a safeguard when exclusive consumption cannot be verified at the point of purchase.
